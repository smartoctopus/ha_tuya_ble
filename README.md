# ARCHIVED: NEVER WORKED & WILL NEVER TRY TO FIX IT

This fork started with a merge of markusg1234's fork. Then, I authored two commits to try to implement support for `vlzqwckk` and `iv7hudlj` (two bluetooth/humidity sensors I bought from Aliexpress), but they didn't work at all.

If someone needs a way to make those two sensors work with Home Assistant, I'm currently using this customized firmware.

The original README is left below:

## Home Assistant support for Tuya BLE devices

### Overview

This integration supports Tuya devices connected via BLE.

_Inspired by code of [@redphx](https://github.com/redphx/poc-tuya-ble-fingerbot)_

_Original HASS component forked from https://github.com/PlusPlus-ua/ha_tuya_ble_

_This forks base is from https://github.com/markusg1234/ha_tuya_ble_


### Installation

Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder). Alternatively install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=patriot1889&repository=ha_tuya_ble&category=integration)

### Usage

After adding to Home Assistant integration should discover all supported Bluetooth devices, or you can add discoverable devices manually.

The integration works locally, but connection to Tuya BLE device requires device ID and encryption key from Tuya IOT cloud. It could be obtained using the same credentials as in the previous official Tuya integration. To obtain the credentials, please refer to official Tuya integration [documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20240204064157/https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tuya/) [[1]](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/blob/a4e6d4819f1db584cc66ba2082508d3978f83f7e/source/_integrations/tuya.markdown)

### Support project
_The following is a comment from the original developer which deserves to stay_


I am working on this integration in Ukraine. Our country was subjected to brutal aggression by Russia. The war still continues. The capital of Ukraine - Kyiv, where I live, and many other cities and villages are constantly under threat of rocket attacks. Our air defense forces are doing wonders, but they also need support. So if you want to help the development of this integration, donate some money and I will spend it to support our air defense.
